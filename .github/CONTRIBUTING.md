# Contributing to this repository

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/kscarlett/humid/issues) to see if an issue exists already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, [open an issue](https://github.com/kscarlett/humid/issues/new). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## Making your changes

When you're ready to start working on your addition, get started by forking this repo.

### Make your update

See [how to add wordlist](../README.md#adding-word-lists) if you want to add a wordlist.

If you want to make a functional change beyond adding a wordlist, we'll probably discuss this in greater depth in the issue.

### Open a pull request

Give your pull request a descriptive title and write a small summary of the changes you've made. In the future, there will be a bot that automatically adds relevant tags. For now, you don't need to worry about this.

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

Once your PR is submitted, the CI steps will run and you should receive automated feedback pretty much immediately. If all CI steps pass, you can expect a manual review within around a week. If there are no further comments, your PR will be approved and merged.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! :tada:

Once your changes have been merged, they will be scheduled to be released in the next release (if it's a small change) or they will be made into a new release.
